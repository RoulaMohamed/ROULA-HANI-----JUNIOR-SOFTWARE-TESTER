Regarding the Bonus Task:
- Check the TRELLA_TASK_3.xls file that includes all the test cases required for the login and some of the search functionality test cases.
- TRELLA_BONUS_TASK.zip includes my python selenium code for automating the UI tests.
- Check file "TS_1_TC_LOGIN_3_6.py" that runs two suggested test cases from the TRELLA_TASK_3.xls test case data.
- The file "Get_Test_Data.py" is a helper function that I created to retrieve the test data I require for a specific test case from the excel sheet.
- The file "Automate_login_tests.py" is a code that I was working on to automate all login test cases combinations.
